Note: Before you use any of these directly (in other words, not through 7gen), 
copy (don't move) them into the parent directory. The pathing doesn't work if they are in /bin. 

Also, make sure you get BOTH files. 
For example, if you want to use actorextractorGUI, you need to copy both actorextractor.py 
and actorextractorGUI.py into the parent directory. 
(If you don't want to use the GUI, you only need the non-GUI file though)
